# Uniform commerce starter for BigCommerce and Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Create a new project on uniform.app
1. Create API key with permissions to modify Canvas.
1. Add your uniform api keys to .env
1. Install packages by running `npm install`

Push artifacts if you create a project from scratch [skip the following two steps if the project was created via onboarding - all artifacts are already pushed in this case]:
1. Run this to push all components and compositions from disk into your project: `npm run push`
1. Run this to push signals and enrichments from disk into your project: 
`push:context:signals`
`push:context:enrichments`

1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
   

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
